# Wikimedia Trends Engine

This project aims to analyze trends in Wikimedia events using Kafka for data ingestion and (future steps involving your chosen technologies for processing and analysis).

**Current progress:**

*   A Kafka producer is set up to fetch real-time events from the Wikimedia stream and publish them to a Kafka topic (`wikimedia_events`).
*   (Optional: if you have a working consumer from yesterday) A basic Kafka consumer can read events from the `wikimedia_events` topic.

**Next Steps:**

*   (List your planned next steps, e.g., develop data processing/transformation logic, explore data analysis techniques, etc.)
